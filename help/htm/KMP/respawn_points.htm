<h1>Respawn Points</h1>
<p>Respawn points are used to respawn karts and blue shells when they go through a fall boundary. Respawn points are linked to checkpoints by the checkpoint&nbsp;<strong>RespawnID</strong> parameter.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>Parameters are displayed in the <strong>entry list</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PositionXYZ:</strong>&nbsp;Position of the respawn point.</li>
<li><strong>RotationXYZ:</strong> Rotation of the respawn point. The direction of the respawn point is shown in the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> (based of the&nbsp;<strong>RotationY</strong> value).</li>
<li><strong>Unknown:</strong> The purpose of this parameter is unknown, normally&nbsp;<strong>FFFF</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can create as many respawn points as the number of checkpoints. It is recommended to space the respawn points so there aren't any large sections of the track without them, even if it is not possible to fall, just in case.</li>
<li>Make sure you set the&nbsp;<strong>RotationY</strong> of the point properly. Use the line shown in the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> to check the direction.&nbsp;</li>
