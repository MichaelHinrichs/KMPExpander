<h1>Routes</h1>
<p>Routes are general purpose paths used with other KMP Sections.</p>
<h3>Group Settings</h3>
<p>Group settings are displayed in the&nbsp;<strong>Group Settings</strong> view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loop</strong>: Defines if the route is looped. If set to <strong>True</strong>, whatever thing is linked to the route will go to the first point after finishing the last one.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth:</strong> Defines if the route path is smoothen. Recommended for opening cameras.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>Parameters are displayed in the <strong>entry list</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PositionXYZ:</strong>&nbsp;Position of the Enemy Point.</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong>&nbsp;The speed of the route. This parameter is not used by some&nbsp;<strong>Objects&nbsp;</strong>(one of the Settings of the object is used instead). Route speed is interpolated between points, so if you don't want whatever thing is linked to the route to never finish the route, set the last point speed to <strong>0</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Setting2:</strong> Used by some&nbsp;<strong>Objects</strong>, its meaning is <strong>ObjectType</strong> specific. (Default value is&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips</h3>
