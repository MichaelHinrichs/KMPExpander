<h1>OBJ Manager</h1>
<p>KMP Expander allows to open a Wavefront .obj file which will be displayed in the editor below the kmp data. This helps having a perspective on how the kmp data will be positioned in the track. Furthermore, by right clicking on compatible entry points, its Y coordinate will be calculated automatically.</p>
<h3>OBJ Manager Window</h3>
<p>The OBJ manager window can be opened by clicking&nbsp;<strong>OBJ Manager</strong> under the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load OBJ:&nbsp;</strong>Opens an .obj file.</li>
<li><strong>Close OBJ:&nbsp;</strong>Closes the currently loaded .obj file.</li>
<li><strong>Render OBJ:</strong> Enables/Disables OBJ rendering in the editor.</li>
<li><strong>Wireframe:&nbsp;</strong>Only the lines connecting vertices will be displayed instead of the full model. This is useful to know which triangles will be affected by DIV boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Selects a material from the .obj</li>
<li><strong>Material Settings:&nbsp;</strong>Allows to change some settings from the current selected material. (Description about each parameter can be found below the Material Settings view).</li>

<li>If your model shows completely black, make sure the texture is showing correctly in the texture view and that the diffuse color is not black.</li>
