<h1>UIMapPos</h1>
<p>The UIMapPos file controls how the local and global minimaps are placed in the bottom screen ingame. To&nbsp;<strong>open, save </strong>and<strong> close&nbsp;</strong>UIMapPos files, go to the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> menu. KMP expander only allows to edit local minimap position as how the global minimap coordinates are handled is unknown.</p>
<p>From the&nbsp;<strong>Tools-&gt;UIMapPos</strong> menu you can load an image to the local map box shown in the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> as well as toggle its view.</p>
<h4>Local Minimap</h4>
<p>The local minimap will be displayed in the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> as a black box with two black points on two of its corners. You can move those points to adjust the size of the black box so it matches the 3D model properly.</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>If you load a minimap image, you won't be able to see the OBJ model as it is covered by the image itself. However, you can open the minimap image with an image editor and change its transparency. That way the transparency will also be applied in the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> and you will be able to see the OBJ model through the minimap.</p>
