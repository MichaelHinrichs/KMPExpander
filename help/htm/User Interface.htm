<h1>User Interface</h1>
<p>KMP Expander is divided in four sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tree View (Top Left)</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>From the tree view you can select which KMP/DIV section or section group is loaded to the&nbsp;<strong>entry list&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>group settings</strong> view. By right clicking on compatible section groups you will be able to add new groups or remove existing ones. By checking or unchecking the checkbox, that specific section/group will be hidden in the&nbsp;<strong>editor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group Settings (Botom Left)</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Allows to change the settings for the current selected group (see section specific help for details).</li>
<li><strong>Entry List (Bottom Right):&nbsp;</strong>Displays all the entries of the current selected section/group. You can also edit individual parameters for each entry (see section specific help for details). There are several controls in the top part of the entry list:
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Entry (+):</strong>&nbsp;Adds a new entry below the selected one with default parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Entry (-):</strong> Removes the current selected entry.</li>
<li><strong>Shift Up/Down (^,v):&nbsp;</strong>Moves up or down in the list the current selected entry.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Draw Mode</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(ItemBox with cursor):</strong> With draw mode enabled, clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>editor</strong> will place a new point where the cursor is instead of selecting/moving existing points. Click again to disable.</li>
<li><strong>Change View Plane:</strong> Changes the camera position in the&nbsp;<strong>Editor</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>XZ:&nbsp;</strong>Top to bottom.</li>
<li><strong>XY:</strong> Back to front.</li>
<li><strong>ZY:</strong> Left to right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Play Intro Cameras:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Camera):</strong>Plays the track intro cameras. Press the <strong>Escape</strong> key to stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Editor (Top Right):</strong> This is where all the visible section points will be displayed as well as the <strong>UIMapPos&nbsp;</strong>image,&nbsp;<strong>DIV</strong> boxes and loaded&nbsp;<strong>OBJ</strong>. You can use the editor to move existing points or place new ones with the&nbsp;<strong>Draw Mode</strong> enabled by left clicking. If an&nbsp;<strong>OBJ</strong> is loaded, right clicking on a point will calculate its Y position based on the OBJ geometry.</li>
</ul>
